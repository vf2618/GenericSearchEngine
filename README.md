# GenericSearchEngine
# Author: Vinzenz Freigassner


# requirements are added in requirements.txt
# especially the libraries bs4 and Flask are required


# This is split into two parts the Generic Crawler, Generic_Crawler_v1.py
# And the Search Application, app.py


# The functions can be executed seperately
# For the app.py to display results, it requires the two html webpages to be saved
#     in a folder called "templates" within the local directory.
#     also, a database is required in the form of "database_1.db"
